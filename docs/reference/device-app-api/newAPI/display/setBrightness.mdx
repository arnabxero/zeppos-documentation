# setBrightness

> Start from API_LEVEL `2.0` . Please refer to [API_LEVEL](../../../../guides/framework/device/compatibility.md).

Set the screen brightness of the current device. If the auto brightness setting is currently turned on, the brightness is automatically adjusted by the light sensor, calling `setBrightness` will not take effect at this time, you need to use `setAutoBrightness` to turn off the auto brightness and then set it again. Note: If you exit the current page, you need to consider whether you need to set the brightness back to the original brightness.
