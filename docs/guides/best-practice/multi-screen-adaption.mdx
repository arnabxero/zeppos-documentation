## Introduction to different screens

The screen shape and size of each device can be found in the [Device Basic Information](../../reference/related-resources/device-list.mdx).

The entire area of the round screen is available for developers to draw, while **a status bar** is pre-drawn on square screen devices for application uniformity, as shown in the following image.

![square screen](/img/docs/guides/best-practice/square_screen.jpg)

The height of the status bar is 64 px, the text is displayed on the left and the current time is displayed on the right. The text defaults to the `appName` field in `app.json`, and if the `appName` field is configured in `i18n`, the configuration in `i18n` is used first.

There are the following APIs related to the status bar

- [setStatusBarVisible](../../reference/device-app-api/newAPI/ui/setStatusBarVisible.mdx)
  - Can be used to control the hiding and displaying of the status bar
- [updateStatusBarTitle](../../reference/device-app-api/newAPI/ui/updateStatusBarTitle.mdx)
  - Can be used to set the text to be displayed on the left side of the status bar

## Adaptation scheme

:::tip
If the app.json of the Mini Program uses v3 and above, refer to [Screen Adaptation Specification](../framework/device/screen-adaption.md).
:::

For developers who want a single piece of code that can run on every device, at this stage we have given two options:

- `px` functions: use the `px` functions to scale the screen to the same shape
- Style code is organized by shape: different screen shapes are suggested to be organized separately by screen shape, and the screen shape is judged at runtime to read the corresponding style

## `px` global functions

Implemented a utility function in the `utils` module [utils - `px`](../../reference/device-app-api/newAPI/utils/px.mdx).

The `designWidth` of each model in the `targets` object in the [Mini Program Configuration](../../reference/app-json.mdx) is used as the base for scaling.

As an example, the `targets` in the `app.json` of an application are configured as follows.

```js
{
  ...
  "targets": {
    "gtr-3-pro": {
      "designWidth": 480
    },
    "gtr-3": {
      "designWidth": 480
    },
  }
}
```

As we can see above, the width of the GTR 3 PRO model is `480` and the width of the GTR 3 model is `454`.

In the following, we use `DEVICE_WIDTH` to refer to the real size of the device, so the result of the `px(x)` function is `Math.ceil(x / designWidth * DEVICE_WIDTH)`

On GTR 3 PRO, the value of `designWidth` is configured in `app.json` as `480`, and the size of the model above this document is queried to find the `DEVICE_WIDTH` value of `480`, the result of `px(100)` is `Math.ceil(100 / 480 * 480) = 100`

On GTR 3, the value of `designWidth` is configured in `app.json` as `480`, and the model size above this document is queried to find the `DEVICE_WIDTH` value of `454`, and the result of `px(100)` is `Math.ceil(100 / 480 * 454) = 95`

```js
import { px } from '@zos/utils'

// in GTR 3 PRO
console.log(px(100)) // 100

// in GTR 3
console.log(px(100)) // 95
```

It is recommended to use `480px` as the base for round screen design, and the rest of round screen devices can be scaled equally.

At the coding level, you only need to configure the scaling reference `designWidth` field in `app.json` and wrap the `px` function in an appropriate place in the code to achieve layout adaption.

```js
import { createWidget, widget, text_style, align } from '@zos/ui'
import { px } from '@zos/utils'

const textStyle = {
  x: px(96),
  y: px(40),
  w: px(288),
  h: px(46),
  color: 0xffffff,
  text_size: px(36),
  align_h: align.CENTER_H,
  align_v: align.CENTER_V,
  text_style: text_style.WRAP
}

const text = createWidget(widget.TEXT, textStyle)
```

## Style code is organized by screen shape

Compared with a round screen, a square screen has a little more room to play in UI layout, allowing an application's UI to be partially different on a square screen and a round screen, for which a code organization idea is given.

The core idea is to store the style files independently from the logic, with a separate `styles.js`, to get the shape and size of the device at runtime, and to export different style variables according to the different screen shapes.

Get screen-related information through the [`getDeviceInfo`](../../reference/device-app-api/newAPI/device/getDeviceInfo.mdx) API.

```js title="index.style.js"
import { getDeviceInfo, SCREEN_SHAPE_SQUARE, SCREEN_SHAPE_ROUND } from '@zos/device'
import { align, text_style } from '@zos/ui'
import { px } from '@zos/utils'

const deviceInfo = getDeviceInfo()
const { width, height, screenShape } = deviceInfo

const processStyles = (styleObj = {}) => {
  return styleObj[screenShape]
}

const HOME_TITLE = {
  [SCREEN_SHAPE_ROUND]: {
    attrs: {
      text: 'Hello World Round'
    },
    x: px(96),
    y: px(40),
    w: px(288),
    h: px(46),
    color: 0xffffff,
    text_size: px(36),
    align_h: align.CENTER_H,
    align_v: align.CENTER_V,
    text_style: text_style.WRAP
  },
  [SCREEN_SHAPE_SQUARE]: {
    attrs: {
      text: 'Hello World Square',
      x: 32,
      y: 11,
      w: 232,
      h: 42,
      color: 0x666666,
      text_size: 32,
      align_h: align.CENTER_H,
      align_v: align.CENTER_V,
      text_style: text_style.NONE
    }
  }
}

export default {
  HOME_TITLE: processStyles(HOME_TITLE)
}
```
