## Intro

The growth of Zepp OS cannot be separated from the support and help of the community developers.

The Zepp OS team has always been open to suggestions from the community and continues to provide developers with a high degree of freedom and a more powerful system API, while at the same time, listening to criticisms and opinions, and constantly optimizing performance and system stability.

Over the past two years, developers have used their strong coding skills, wisdom and creativity to contribute many high-quality works to the Zepp OS ecosystem, serving the majority of Zepp OS users and creating value.

The Zepp OS team organizes many developer events and competitions, and gives generous material rewards to developers who actively participate.
