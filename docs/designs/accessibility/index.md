Accessibility design in Zepp OS is mainly a consideration for users who are visually impaired. It ensures that people with visual impairment can better obtain information, and it can adapt to different devices and complex lighting environments to ensure comfortable reading and better product experience. Based on accessibility design considerations, the product design needs to ensure natural perception, convenient operation, and clear understanding.
