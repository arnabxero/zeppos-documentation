# Switching pages

## Same-level pages

Refers to switching between pages of the same priority level, such as horizontal movement between widgets, horizontal movement between motion pages, and vertical movement between content pages.

## Parent-child pages

- Access deeper levels of content in the app's hierarchy by going from parent pages(high-level) to child pages (lower-level).
- Go through an ordered process page, such as setting height and weight.
- Go from one page to any other page in the app, such as from a Watchface to a page within an app.
- Return from a child page to the parent page.
