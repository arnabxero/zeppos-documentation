# Languages

## Default text 

Use the Zepp OS default font library for design and development. English is the default language when the product cannot match the language. It is recommended to design based on the English version.

## Capitalization

For the use of capitalization and lowercase in different languages, it is necessary to judge the language type first. Do not use capitalization and lowercase alone to convey a necessary message.

## Punctuation

Make sure that the punctuation marks are localized, and pay special attention to the placement of punctuation when wrapping lines.

System special symbols

| **Name** | **Symbol** |
| -------- | ---------- |
| Angle    | °          |
| Minute   | ′          |
| sec      | ″          |

## Units

Units need to be localized. Only the United States, Liberia, and Myanmar use the imperial system. Other countries or regions use the metric system. Hong Kong, China, and Canada use a mixture of the two systems. Pay attention to the localization of some units, such as km.
