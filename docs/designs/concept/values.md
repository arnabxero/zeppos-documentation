# Design values

Design values are the core of our design system. They provide a guideline and direction for Zepp OS product design and all design activities are carried out based on these design values.

## Natural

Natural design connects the real-world experience with product design by arousing user cognition, so that users can quickly understand and feel related, which ensures a comfortable experience while using the wearable device.

**Natural recognition:** Express elements and content presented on the smart wearable interface using the essence of natural elements, including visual, auditory, tactile, and other means that conform to the laws of nature, such that they are self-evident and easy to understand. This helps to reduce the user's cognitive load and create a harmonious, visually pleasurable, and natural product experience.

**Natural interaction:** Choose recognition over recall. System operation must be consistent with the process, logic, and habits in real life. Strive for high adaptability to the user's daily habits by means of scenario definition, behavior analysis, cloud computing, and AI algorithms. Give users the sense that they are in full control of the interface. Improve natural interaction and help users understand and use the product with ease.

## Simple

Zepp OS is a system designed for wearable devices. Therefore, product design should consider and utilize device features, analyze usage scenarios, focus on core features, and be suitable for wearers, thereby providing them with a simple and lightweight user experience.

**Simple interface:** The element style should be simple and straightforward, the interface structure should be clear with proper information hierarchy, the core features should be distinct, and the key information should be highlighted to help users acquire information with higher efficiency.

**Simple operation:** Operations on smart wearable devices should be adapted to small screens and use short paths. Interfaces should be as simple as possible with proper information hierarchy, so that users can quickly complete tasks through simple operations.

**Easy to understand:** Consider the usage scenarios and introduce advanced features through gradual guidance and clear demonstrations to reduce the user's learning burden and cognitive load, so that they can quickly understand and make decisions.

## Symbiosis

As a system running on personal wearable devices, Zepp OS is closely connected with users. In product design, consider user requirements, product values and technological development, and integrate them into one system so that they can develop together.

**Experience symbiosis:** Wearable devices create a more intimate connection with the wearer through physical devices. To provide better user experience, hardware and software should complement each other and work together. A good system design considers the development of hardware and software and reduces the physical boundaries between them, giving users a better experience and making the product more versatile and competitive.

**Value symbiosis:** The opinions, pain points, preferences, and requirements of users are the core of product design. Designers should think about design in a systematic way, gain insight into the value of product features, provide services to users, establish a connection between value and demand, and allow product value to be discovered. Efforts should be made to help users pay more attention to themselves and improve their health and quality of life.
