# Keywords

Based on the concepts of "beauty," "health," and "warmth," we depict a living scene: soft light shines through translucent glass, projecting blurry colors and mottled reflections on the glass.

From these scenes, we extracted three visual keywords: frosted glass, light and shadow, colors.

We visualize the "light" with the trait of "warmth": When a translucent glass-like object is placed on the top layer, the color changes, light and shadow refraction, and spatial expression it produces make the vision of Zepp OS closer to life and nature.
