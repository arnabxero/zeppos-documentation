# Text

## Design principles

**Meaningful**: The text should help the user make a choice, take an action, or understand the current state.

**Concise and comfortable**: The text should be simple, user-friendly, and relevant. Keep the user focused on the task and make the user feel good.

## Title

**Main titles**

- The main title is used to explain or summarize the content of the next level.

- The main title should be consistent with the name of the feature on the previous interface.

**Subtitles**

- When the main title cannot fully convey the content, add subtitles to supplement the information.

>① The subtitle should have a lower-level style than the main title to show the page hierarchy.

## Body text

The body text should show the full text without omission.

- Description text and introductions.
