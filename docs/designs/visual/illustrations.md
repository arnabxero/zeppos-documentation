# Illustrations

As an important part of the product's visual experience, illustrations can express information graphically, improve legibility and aesthetic experience to a certain extent, and shape the brand image.

## Design principles

## Visual Guidelines

The main body of the illustration should be cut to size ③, with a transparent safety margin reserved inside.

The illustration graphic area is marked as ①, and the drawing area should generally be kept within the range of ②. If the graphic needs to add additional visual weight to ensure consistency with other icons, the drawing area can be extended into the reserve area (note: A 2px safety distance needs to be kept at the edge when cutting the image).
