# Loading

Loading refers to the continuous feedback provided to the user when the system cannot respond quickly to achieve the user's goal after receiving the user's instructions. It relieves user anxiety as they wait, informs the user of the current task status, and maintains communication with the user.

## Rules for use

During the loading process, the natural circular animation effect should be maintained. Loading without animation gives users the impression that the interface has frozen.

## Visual specifications

The overall layout is oriented towards the upper part to keep the visual focal point in the center.
