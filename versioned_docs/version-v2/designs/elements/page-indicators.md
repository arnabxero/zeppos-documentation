# Page indicators

## **Scroll bars**

A scroll bar is a control used to indicate the current position on a page as the user scrolls down a long page.

### Rules for use

- If the content on the interface exceeds the display area, the scroll bar will be displayed at a fixed position when the user enters the page. If no operation is performed, the scroll bar will disappear after 2 seconds (the scroll bar will be displayed again if the user touches the screen or uses the crown to interact).
- The background bar ➁ has a fixed length, while the length of the dynamic bar ➀ changes dynamically with the length of the content. The longer the content, the shorter the dynamic bar.

## **Horizontal pagination**

Pagination points are used to display the number of horizontal pages and the current page location.

### Rules for use

- When there are multiple horizontal pages, pagination points are displayed at the top.
- The number of pagination points is same as that of horizontal pages displayed on the screen. The user can swipe left or right or rotate the crown to switch to the corresponding page.
