# Progress

The progress indicator provides feedback on the current task progress and reasonable time consumption. It guides uses to complete the target tasks and makes the wait clear and hassle-free.

## Design goals

- Help the user understand the current status and provide sufficient support for the user's subsequent decision-making.
- Provide well-founded reasons for the wait to ease user anxiety while waiting.

## Horizontal progress bars
