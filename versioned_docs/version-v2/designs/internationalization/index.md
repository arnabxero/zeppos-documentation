# Introduction

For products and applications to be released globally, globalization processes need to be considered, namely **"**internationalization**"** and **"**localization**"**.

Internationalization, referred to as "**i18n**", is a convergent design method that meets the needs of different countries through a certain type of solution.

Localization, referred to as "**L10n**"**,** is a solution customized for each country.

The strategy of internationalization + localization, that is, "glocal - global+local", refers to the combination of international unity and regional differences. Under the premise of unity, this strategy provides flexible configurations to ensure personalized user experience in different regions. As a cost-effective design solution, it can satisfy the requirements for unified maintenance, improve product efficiency, and meet the special demands of local users.

This guide summarizes the common problems encountered in internationalization and localization design. The following rules help to achieve effective globalization of products and applications.
