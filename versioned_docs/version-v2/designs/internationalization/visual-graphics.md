# Visual graphics

- Try to use common graphic images (for common graphic images, see: [Illustration](../visual/illustrations.md)), and reduce the metaphors used in graphics, images, and colors.
- Avoid the use of gestures to convey meaning in graphic designs.
- Avoid religious, mythological, politically related content, signs, symbols, and similar.
