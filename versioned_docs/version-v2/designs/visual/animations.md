# Animations

The Zepp OS "Air" dynamic animation system creates an operation experience with a sense of nature, space, and transparency to vitalize the product.

**Nature**: Follow the physical laws of nature, display perceptible changes in the elements of the real world, and allow users to recognize, understand, and accept them more quickly.

**Space**: Create a vertical visual space using animations, strengthen page structure and the relationship between parent-child pages, and establish a sense of space and order. Give users a more direct perception of the connection between interfaces.

**Transparency**: The best animations are the ones the user doesn't notice at all. The movement is silent and imperceptible and the effects are only perceived when needed. They are concise, moderate, and appropriate.

## Design principles

**Natural and smooth**

The animations should be visually consistent, and the movement method should conform to the laws of natural movement.

**Clear hierarchy**

The animations must clearly express the hierarchical relationship within the system, so that the connection between interfaces is natural and clear, and users can perceive the page structure through animations.

**Exercise restraint**

Due to the screen size limitation of wearable devices, animations should be concise and moderate. Reduce animation elements and motion paths. Do not exceed the user's operation time limit. Pay attention to the psychological impact of the animations on the user.

## Icon animations

Icon guidance animations use the change of icon elements in the interface to attract user's attention or guide user operation. Reduce the interference of other visual elements to keep the user focused.

Icon transition animation, an animated icon between two visual states. Toggling between the two icons means they are linked, and pressing one icon makes the other available.

## Illustration animations

Illustrated animations can enhance the visual information expressed, engage usersâ€™ emotions, and help them understand features and processes.

- Transition animations

    Transition animations in measurement apps can reduce user anxiety while they are waiting for the results.

- Motivational animations

    Motivational animations can stimulate positive emotions as users interact with and use the product.

- Guide animations

    Guide animations help users quickly understand how to conduct operations, reduce confusion, and complete tasks.

## Chart animations

Chart animations can make it easier to read charts, reduce feelings of monotony, and improve the user experience.

## Control animations

Control animations use animations to reflect an element's operation logic.

- Radio button

- Checkbox

- Delete

- Toasts

## Page animations

Page animations are used to display switching between different pages in the system and indicate the page hierarchy.

## Rules for use

**Basic time unit**

Regardless of the animation style, the animation transition time should not be too long or too short. Animations with moderate transitions can bring users a comfortable experience.

Based on the scope and type of animation, animation transition time intervals can be divided into the following types:

Shortest time: 200 ms, median time: 300 ms, long time: 400 ms. Subsequent time intervals are divided by multiples of 100 ms.

- Shortest time: Lightweight interactive animation of controls, such as radio buttons and checkboxes.
- Median time: Interactive animations for page switching, such as toasts, page switching, and deletion.
- Long time: Chart animations, such as indicator animations.
- Custom animation time: illustrations and icon animations, such as animated instruction for wearing a watch.

**Animation curve**

In the physical world, elements do not move or stop immediately. Instead, they are affected by natural forces such as friction and gravity, and take time to accelerate and decelerate, which is also known as easing.

- Movement shift animations

    The movement of an object within the visible range is ease-in-out, cubic-bezier (.42,0,.58,1)

- Entry animations

    The movement of an object into the visible range is ease-out, cubic-bezier (0,0,.58,1)

![Design](/img/design/ffd916968c3ec5067aad82f0daed31bf.gif)

- Exit animations

    The movement of an object out of the visible range is ease-in, cubic-bezier (.42,0,1,1)
