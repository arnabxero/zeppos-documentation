# Switching pages

## Same-level pages

Refers to switching between pages of the same priority level, such as swiping left and right to switch between quick access apps and swiping up and down to turn pages in an app.

## Parent-child pages

- Access deeper levels of content in the app's hierarchy by going from parent pages to child pages.
- Go through an ordered process page, such as setting height and weight.
- Go from one page to any other page in the app, such as from a Watchface to a page within an app.
- Return from a child page to the parent page.
