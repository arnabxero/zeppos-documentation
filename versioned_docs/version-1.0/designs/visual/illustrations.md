# Illustrations

As an important part of the product's visual experience, illustrations can express information graphically, improve legibility and aesthetic experience to a certain extent, and shape the brand image.

## **Design principles**

Zepp OS illustrations follow the "lightweight", "friendly", and "effective" design principles. Use lightweight and concise graphics, reduce excessive modeling combinations, convey friendly and appropriate emotions, and express the meaning in a clear and easy-to-understand manner to ensure efficient operation for the user.

## **Types**

### Illustrations of status descriptions

### Third-party app illustrations

## **Rules for use**

- The basic visual style of system illustrations is white graphics ①.
- Use gray graphics ② in empty page status illustrations for apps.
- For the empty pages of quick access apps (indicating that connection to mobile application is required for operation), use color graphics. To ensure that the user understands, the app icon is usually used ③.
- In guidance and feedback illustrations with animations, you can add full-screen animations to decorate the background layer.

## **Visual specifications**

The size of the main slice of the illustration is ③, and a blank and transparent safe area should be reserved inside.

The illustration graphics area is ①, and the drawing area should generally be kept within the range of ②. If the graphic needs extra visual weight to ensure consistency with other icons, the drawing area can be extended to the reserved area (note: a 2px safety distance must be maintained around the edge when making the slice).
