# Design principles

Design principles are concrete and feasible guidelines and tips for practicing design values. They describe the benchmarks and design constraints in the design process.

## Friendly

Friendly feedback: The interface is under the user's control. Offer appropriate feedback through emotionally considerate design to soothe the user's negative emotions and promote positive emotions.

Friendly guidance: Use timely notifications and guidance to help users better complete tasks and solve problems.

Friendly and universal: Focus on inclusiveness to ensure barrier-free and international designs. Pay attention to the user experience of key groups and in special scenarios while considering the requirements of most users. Expand product target groups and allow more users to easily and efficiently use the product.

## Light

Light interface: Keep the interface concise and clear at all times and remove visual clutter, so that users can focus on truly useful information.

Light layering: Reflect the layering and spatial relationship between elements and establish cognitive continuity between the user and the interface.

Light operation: Provide lighter operation and effortless cognition to vitalize the interface.

Light process: In feature process design, use short paths where possible to improve feature use efficiency.

## Efficient

Efficient design: System design is the product of labor division and cooperation. Explore design rules and modular design ideas, provide abstract rules, components and patterns for partners, enhance the flexibility and maintainability of interface design, reduce unnecessary design elements, maintain system consistency, and improve design efficiency.

Efficient use: Always pay attention to the effectiveness of product use, focus on specific user requirements, and provide users with a flexible and satisfying individual experience.
