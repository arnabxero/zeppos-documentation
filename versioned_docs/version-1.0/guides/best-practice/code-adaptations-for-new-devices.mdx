Developers have already built an Mini Program based on one device, how can they get it to run on more Zepp OS devices?

This article helps developers quickly adapt existing Mini Program code to more Zepp OS-enabled devices.

Zepp OS Mini Programs are designed with compatibility in mind, so there is no need for developers to adjust the code too much.

- `app.json` configuration
- Screen differences
- Physical keys, crown differences

## `app.json` configuration

With the `targets` field in [app.json - Mini Program Configuration](../../reference/app-json.mdx), you can pass in different build configurations for different devices.

The key name of each `target` can be named arbitrarily, it is recommended to use the device name to do the naming, this name corresponds to the Mini Program resource file `/assets` directory subdirectory, you can refer to the [Folder Structure](../architecture/folder-structure.mdx).

Look at an example that lists some of the configuration in `app.json`.

```json title="app.json"
{
  // ...
  "targets": {
    "gtr-3-pro": {
      "module": {
        // ···
      },
      "platforms": [
        {
          "name": "gtr-3-pro",
          "deviceSource": 229
        },
        {
          "name": "gtr-3-prow",
          "deviceSource": 230
        }
      ],
      "designWidth": 480
    }
  }
}
```

Part of the directory structure of this Mini Program.

```txt
.
├── app.js
├── app.json
├── assets
│   ├── gtr-3-pro
│   │   ├── icon.png
│   │   └── image
│   │       └── logo.png
...
```

In this `targets` configuration, `gtr-3-pro` is used as the key name of a build configuration, named after the device name, corresponding to the `/assets` resource directory, and the resource files associated with this device are placed in the `gtr-3-pro` directory.

For example, `src: 'image/logo.png'` in the parameters of the `IMG` widget, the corresponding image path in this target configuration is `/assets/gtr-3-pro/image/logo.png`.

Why there are more than one `deviceSource` for the same GTR 3 PRO device, you don't need to care about this issue, just fill in the `deviceSource` in [Device Basic Information](../../reference/related-resources/device-list.mdx).

The following is a practical exercise to adapt this GTR3 PRO-only Mini Program to GTR3 models.

1. First add the target configuration for GTR3, fill in the relevant configuration

```json title="app.json"
{
  // ...
  "targets": {
    "gtr-3-pro": {
      "module": {
        // ···
      },
      "platforms": [
        {
          "name": "gtr-3-pro",
          "deviceSource": 229
        },
        {
          "name": "gtr-3-prow",
          "deviceSource": 230
        }
      ],
      "designWidth": 480
    },
    "gtr-3": {
      "module": {
        // ···
      },
      "platforms": [
        {
          "name": "gtr-3",
          "deviceSource": 226
        },
        {
          "name": "gtr-3w",
          "deviceSource": 227
        }
      ],
      "designWidth": 480
    }
  }
}
```

2. Create a folder under the `/assets` directory with the targets key name and place the resource files in it

:::caution
Suggestion: the image resource file needs to be scaled according to the screen ratio, which can have a better adaptation effect

│   ├── gtr-3
│   │   ├── icon.png
│   │   └── image
│   │       └── logo.png
│   └── gtr-3-pro
│       ├── icon.png
│       └── image
│           └── logo.png
...
```

## Different screen adaptations

You can refer to [Screen Adaptation](../best-practice/multi-screen-adaption.mdx) for more information about adapting the Mini Program to different screens.

## Physical keys, crown logic adaptation

Products with Zepp OS will have a different number of physical keys depending on the scenario, and some models will be equipped with a digital crown. For more information about the layout and naming of the keys, please refer to the [Physical keys](../../reference/related-resources/physical-keys.mdx)。

For the adaptation of the physical keys and crown logic, the corresponding code logic needs to be adjusted, referring to the corresponding button event and crown event APIs.
