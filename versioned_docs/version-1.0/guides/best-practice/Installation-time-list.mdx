## Remarks

- Each step in the table follows the steps on the guide doc, which is relatively time-saving.
- The download time of the software is not counted.
- The timer is a mobile phone stopwatch, less than 1min is calculated by 1min.
- When using `npm` to install `zeus-cli` , sometimes due to network problems resulting in installation errors, need to repeat the installation several times, will take a little longer. If the problem has not been solved, you can first execute `npm install -g cnpm --registry = https://registry.npm.taobao.org` , and then execute `cnmp install`.
- The above environmental configuration and installation may be affected by factors such as network environment, and the actual effect of your mileage may vary for reference only.
