Zepp OS Mini Programs provide developers with a JavaScript runtime environment to implement various capabilities such as UI interactions and manipulating sensors.

The device application uses the `hmUI` control module to implement UI interactions and calls the `hmUI.createWidget` API to draw UI controls. In addition, the `hmUI` control includes an event system that allows developers to handle view interaction logic.

In addition to the controls module, the following modules are provided for developers to give full play to their imagination and creativity:

- `hmSensor` sensor module
- `hmBle` Bluetooth communication module
- `hmFS` file system module
- `hmSetting` system module
- `hmApp` device module

At the same time, the "lifecycle" of the Mini Program and the page makes it easy for developers to call the corresponding code at the right time. The "routing" can simulate the interaction effect of multiple pages, so that the Mini Program can also manage complex logic.
